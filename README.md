# Pomelo Lang (PMLO)
A stack-based, slightly eccentric language made by me :)

I'd love to have a language to compare it to here, but I am yet to find one.

Pomelo is currently both interpreted and transpiled into C!!

Full docs are [here](https://github.com/irishgreencitrus/PMLO/blob/main/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md)

> Footnote: This is very early stages.
> Anything could happen to this project.
> Breaking changes, no support, removing the interpreter / transpiler.
> I don't care.
